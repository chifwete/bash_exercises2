**#Introduction**

*This is my first script.*

I learnt how to properly document my script,upload script in a folder and push the folder from the commandline to the created repo.

The script in this repo contains codes that were used to create a directory, different subdirectories in the main directory and files numbered differently in each directory.
 It can be useful in creating various files and directories.
